# Data Processing Using Python

In this project, I will be doing data processing in Jupyter Notebook. All the codes will be provided here

I will be discussing how to download, load, merge, clean and aggregate the COVID-19 time series dataset. The dataset is provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) on a public Github page. The dataset is updated every day.

I would like to give all the credits to Bindi Chen who published a article on Medium showing great insights for how to process with such a big and complicated dataset.
