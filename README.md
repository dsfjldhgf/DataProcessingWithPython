# Data Processing Using Python

In this project, I am doing data processing using python on Jupyter Notebook. We will be discussing how to download dataset, load, merge, clean and aggregate the COVID-19 time series data. The dataset is provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) on a public Github page. The dataset is updated every day.
