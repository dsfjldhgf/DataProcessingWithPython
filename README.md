# Data Processing Using Python

In this project, I will be doing data processing with python in Jupyter Notebook. All the codes will be provided here.

I will be discussing how to download, load, merge, clean and aggregate the COVID-19 time series dataset. The dataset is provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) on a public Github page. The dataset is updated every day.

I would like to give all the credits to Bindi Chen who published a article on Medium showing great insights for how to process with such a big and complicated dataset.

The dataset can be downloaded at https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series. 
We are only focusing on 'time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv', 'time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv' and 'time_series_covid19_recovered_global.csv'.
